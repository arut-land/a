# MCP client choice and cost

Measured on the shared macOS development machine, 2026-10-21. Build jobs
are limited to three. Latency benchmarks are deliberately deferred to a
quiet machine: first-turn timings under simultaneous sibling builds
would not establish a regression or its absence.

## Library survey

A throwaway manifest outside the repository resolved three clients. For
each, `cargo tree -e normal -p <name> --prefix none --format '{p}'`
counted distinct package/version lines, including the root, removing
repeated `(*)` markers. No surveyed client was compiled or added here.

| Client | Features selected | Distinct packages | Runtime violation |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| rmcp 3.6.0 | no defaults; client, transport-child-process | 54 | tokio 1.54.0 |
| rust-mcp-sdk 2.0.0 | no defaults; client, stdio | 67 | tokio 1.54.0 |
| mcp-sdk 0.0.3 | defaults | 61 | tokio 1.54.0 |

Manifests: [rmcp](https://docs.rs/crate/rmcp/3.6.0/features),
[rust-mcp-sdk](https://docs.rs/crate/rust-mcp-sdk/2.0.0/source/Cargo.toml),
[mcp-sdk](https://docs.rs/crate/mcp-sdk/0.0.3). Each fails the runtime
budget before code-size or CPU comparisons are meaningful. Adapting them
would require replacing their runtime-dependent client implementation.
We therefore implement only the tool client subset over `json` (through
`protocol::Json`), serde_json, `rt` and the existing process spawner.

Streamable HTTP reuses `llm::Http` / `llm::Ureq`, including backpressure
and socket shutdown when dropped. There is no second reactor, HTTP
implementation or TLS configuration. Base64 uses maintained `base64`
0.23, already present through ureq, rather than a custom encoder.

## Release size

`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=3 mise run size` before changes: **2975 KiB**. The same
command after changes is recorded below after final validation. The
fixture is behind a test feature and is not linked into the shipped `a`.
No wire encoding was changed.

## First-turn work

The daemon test verifies a configured server has not started after a
session's ordinary first turn. With no servers, the extension contributes
nothing. With configured servers, registration constructs one compact
server index and three static SDK tool specifications; it performs no
server I/O and starts no background work. Schema discovery happens only
inside a logged tool call. Three-server first-turn work is exercised by
the companion black-box invariant, rather than timed on this busy host.

Owner follow-up: on a quiet host measure identical first turns with zero
and three configured servers, with a warm daemon and isolated homes,
and run budgets/startup. Prompt bytes grow by the compact index, so model
provider latency cannot be asserted to be identical without measurement.
